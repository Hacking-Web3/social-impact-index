# SIO REGISTERY - CELO HACKATHON 1-3 April 2022

Social Impact Organizations Registery
## Goal of the project

Create an usefull and environmental friendly, mobile focused, project around crowdfunding 💡

### Primer 🧠

SIO Registery lets you donate to your favorite causes more easily! 🍃 and much more... 

On the platorm you will be able to submit the information of the social organization of your choice, so anyone can come and donate. 💸
It can be either an existing one such as WWF for the animals or Earthjustice for the environment, or you can just create a new one for different reasons. For example you live in Barcelona and wants to help the people on the street ? No problem, come to SIO Registery, put all the informations, collect money for the good cause, and help the people around you ! 😊

But what if you want to help a whole cause, like the climate protection ?¿ Well, we've thought about it and implemented the possibility to create Indexes ! On SIO Registery you can create new Indexes, regrouping different associations, where you can choose the repartition of the funds.
So when someone donate to a Index the money is automatically spread into the different associations !!! 

Isn't it amazing ? 😁

Once the organization or indexes are available, anyone can come and start donate cryptos for a good cause !! :)

# SIO REGISTERY - CELO HACKATHON 1-3 April 2022

Social Impact Organizations Registery
## Goal of the project

Create an usefull and environmental friendly, mobile focused, project around crowdfunding 💡

### Primer 🧠

SIO Registery lets you donate to your favorite causes more easily! 🍃 and much more... 

On the platorm anyone is able to submit the information of the social impact organization of their choice, so anyone can come and create valuable impact 💸
It can be either an existing one such as WWF for the animals or Earthjustice for the environment, or you can just create a new one for different reasons. For example you live in Barcelona and wants to help the people on the street ? No problem, come to Social Impact Index, put all the informations, collect money for the good cause, and help the people around you ! 😊

But what if you want to help a whole cause, like the climate protection ?¿ Well,
we've thought about it and implemented the possibility to create Indexes! On Social Impact Index you can create new Indexes, regrouping different associations, where you can choose the repartition of the funds.
So when someone donate to a Index the money is automatically spread to different organizations!!! 

Isn't it amazing ? 😁

Once the organization or indexes are available, anyone can come and start donate cryptos for a good cause !! :)

### Technical details ⚙️
The whole index is built using most advanced decentralized tech stack. We used Ceramic for data handling relative to user, organization and index information and blockchain as the tool to distribute and track value transfer between organizations and altruists. Ceramic allows users maintain the control over their data and keeping it as decentralized as possible 

### Problems identified 🛠️
 * Permissionless decentralized registries need to implement some curation mechanism. At the beginning the best way to know you are donating for the good cause is to find proper Index created by a community member with proper reputation
